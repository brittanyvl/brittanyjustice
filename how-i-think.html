                    <h2>Data Quality and Validation</h2>
                    <p>In regulated markets, data quality isn't a nice-to-have—it's the foundation of defensible decisions. I build validation into every layer of a system, not as an afterthought but as a core design principle.</p>
                    <p>This means explicit data contracts, automated anomaly detection, and clear lineage from source to output. When something looks wrong, the system should surface it immediately, not bury it in aggregations.</p>

                    <h2>Guardrails for AI and Machine Learning</h2>
                    <p>Machine learning has genuine applications in pharmacy analytics—demand forecasting, anomaly detection, entity resolution. But ML models in regulated environments require guardrails that most implementations lack.</p>
                    <p>I'm skeptical of black-box predictions for high-stakes decisions. Models should be interpretable, their limitations documented, and their outputs validated against domain expertise before deployment.</p>

                    <h2>Human-in-the-Loop Systems</h2>
                    <p>The best decision systems don't replace human judgment—they augment it. In procurement and compliance, context matters in ways that algorithms can't fully capture.</p>
                    <p>I design systems that surface relevant information, flag anomalies, and suggest actions, but preserve space for expert override. The goal is to make domain experts more effective, not to automate them away.</p>

                    <h2>Right-Sized Architecture</h2>
                    <p>Not every problem needs a distributed data platform. Some of the most effective decision systems I've built run on surprisingly modest infrastructure because the architecture was matched to the actual requirements.</p>
                    <p>I start with the decision to be made and work backward to the minimum viable system that supports it reliably. Complexity should be earned, not assumed.</p>

                    <h2>Skepticism of Black-Box Decision Systems</h2>
                    <p>In healthcare procurement, decisions have real consequences—patient safety, regulatory compliance, financial exposure. Systems that can't explain their recommendations aren't trustworthy enough for these contexts.</p>
                    <p>I build systems where every output can be traced to its inputs, where assumptions are explicit, and where users can interrogate the logic. Transparency isn't a feature; it's a requirement.</p>
