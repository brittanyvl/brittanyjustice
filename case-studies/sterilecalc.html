                A lightweight procurement calculator for sterile drugs that turns messy dosing, vial, and compliance rules into fast, defensible purchasing math.
                </p>

                <!-- OVERVIEW -->
                <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    SterileCalc is a <strong>user-friendly web application</strong> designed for healthcare professionals and clinic operators who are new to sterile drug procurement.
                    It provides quick, accurate calculations that routinely slow down purchasing decisions: <strong>injection volume conversions</strong> across changing strengths,
                    <strong>cost per dose</strong> under real-world handling rules, <strong>doses per unit</strong> based on vial constraints, and <strong>days remaining until Best Use Date (BUD)</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app is intentionally lightweight (static web) and <strong>works offline</strong> once loaded, making it practical for busy operators who need answers in the moment,
                    not a complex platform rollout.
                </p>
                </div>

                <!-- CONTEXT / RISK -->
                <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>Context / Risk</h3>
                <p>
                    Sterile drug purchasing is full of <strong>hidden "gotchas"</strong> that directly affect patient safety, compliance exposure, and cost. Small mistakes compound quickly:
                    ordering the wrong strength for a protocol, misjudging how many usable doses are available before disposal rules apply, or underestimating waste for
                    <strong>preservative-free vials</strong>. For teams without procurement experience, these calculations are frequently done ad hoc in spreadsheets, by memory, or not at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SterileCalc reduces that risk by <strong>encoding the math and the rules</strong> into a simple tool that provides real-time feedback as inputs change.
                </p>
                </div>

                <!-- THE PROBLEM -->
                <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    New procurement stakeholders often inherit sterile sourcing responsibilities <strong>without the context</strong> required to price and compare products correctly.
                    The same drug can appear in multiple strengths, vial sizes, and packaging formats, with different waste characteristics depending on:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Prescribed dose</strong> and dosing frequency</li>
                    <li><strong>Drug concentration</strong> (strength per mL)</li>
                    <li><strong>Vial size</strong> and pack quantity</li>
                    <li><strong>Preservative status</strong> (preserved vs preservative-free)</li>
                    <li><strong>Supplier type</strong> and regulatory constraints (503A patient-specific vs 503B/commercial shared use)</li>
                    <li><strong>USP &lt;797&gt;</strong> handling guidance for puncture/disposal windows</li>
                    <li><strong>Best Use Date (BUD)</strong> and shelf-life expectations</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Without a consistent calculator, teams struggle to <strong>compare options apples-to-apples</strong>, especially when switching suppliers during shortages.
                </p>
                </div>

                <!-- WHY EXISTING APPROACHES FAILED -->
                <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>Why Existing Approaches Failed</h3>
                <p>
                    Most teams try to solve these calculations with <strong>one-off spreadsheets</strong>, tribal knowledge, or scattered notes. That approach breaks down because:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Spreadsheets rarely enforce <strong>unit consistency</strong> (mcg/mg/g) and are easy to mis-key.</li>
                    <li><strong>Waste and disposal rules</strong> are often ignored or applied inconsistently across buyers.</li>
                    <li><strong>503A restrictions</strong> (patient-specific use) fundamentally change dose availability.</li>
                    <li>People need an answer <strong>quickly</strong> while evaluating quotes, not a "modeling project."</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    SterileCalc was built as a <strong>"fast truth" layer</strong>: transparent inputs, immediate outputs, and logic aligned with real procurement constraints.
                </p>
                </div>

                <!-- SYSTEM DESIGN -->
                <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>System Design</h3>
                <p>
                    SterileCalc is a <strong>static web application</strong> built with HTML/CSS/JavaScript to maximize speed, accessibility, and portability.
                    The interface is optimized for use on both desktop and mobile devices, and the app <strong>works offline</strong> once loaded.
                </p>

                <h4>Core Design Principles</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Right-sized:</strong> no backend required, fast load, low maintenance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transparent:</strong> users can see exactly what assumptions drive results.</li>
                    <li><strong>Constraint-aware:</strong> calculations incorporate real-world sterile rules and purchasing restrictions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Immediate feedback:</strong> outputs update as inputs change to support quote evaluation and scenario checking.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Rule-Aware Logic</h4>
                <p>
                    The calculators encode <strong>procurement-relevant sterile constraints</strong> including USP &lt;797&gt; puncture/disposal guidance and sourcing restrictions for
                    503A versus 503B/commercial purchasing.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Preservative-free</strong> products assume disposal after a short puncture window (higher waste risk).</li>
                    <li><strong>Preserved</strong> products allow longer reuse windows (lower waste risk), bounded by BUD.</li>
                    <li><strong>503A purchases</strong> are treated as patient-specific, limiting usable doses per vial/unit based on a patient's 28-day protocol constraints.</li>
                    <li><strong>503B/commercial</strong> purchases assume shared use across patients (bulk in-office workflows).</li>
                </ul>
                </div>

                <p>
                    SterileCalc is built for <strong>non-procurement specialists</strong> who are responsible for buying and administering sterile drugs, including <strong>clinic operators</strong>, <strong>nurse-led practices</strong>,
                    <strong>med spa owners</strong>, and <strong>new procurement stakeholders</strong> who need fast, reliable calculations without building complex spreadsheets.

                <h3>Technical Notes</h3>
                <p>
                    SterileCalc is implemented as a <strong>static site with vanilla JavaScript</strong>. Key implementation patterns include unit normalization (mcg/mg/g),
                    defensive input validation, and transparent result strings designed to educate the user while answering the question.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Static web app:</strong> HTML/CSS/JS for speed, simplicity, and easy deployment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deterministic calculation functions:</strong> reusable functions for dose conversion, total content, doses per unit, cost per dose, and BUD math.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rule-aware branching:</strong> distinct logic paths for 503A vs 503B/commercial and preservative-free vs preserved handling assumptions.</li>
                    <li><strong>UX for clarity:</strong> inputs grouped by protocol, drug details, and supplier constraints to mirror how procurement evaluates products.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The app includes a clear disclaimer to reinforce that it supports procurement calculations and <strong>does not replace clinical judgment</strong>.
