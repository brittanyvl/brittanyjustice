                A lightweight procurement calculator for sterile drugs that turns messy dosing, vial, and compliance rules into fast, defensible purchasing math.
                </p>

                <!-- OVERVIEW -->
                <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    SterileCalc is a user-friendly web application designed for healthcare professionals and clinic operators who are new to sterile drug procurement.
                    It provides quick, accurate calculations that routinely slow down purchasing decisions: injection volume conversions across changing strengths,
                    cost per dose under real-world handling rules, doses per unit based on vial constraints, and days remaining until Best Use Date (BUD).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app is intentionally lightweight (static web) and works offline once loaded, making it practical for busy operators who need answers in the moment,
                    not a complex platform rollout.
                </p>
                </div>

                <!-- CONTEXT / RISK -->
                <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>Context / Risk</h3>
                <p>
                    Sterile drug purchasing is full of hidden "gotchas" that directly affect patient safety, compliance exposure, and cost. Small mistakes compound quickly:
                    ordering the wrong strength for a protocol, misjudging how many usable doses are available before disposal rules apply, or underestimating waste for
                    preservative-free vials. For teams without procurement experience, these calculations are frequently done ad hoc in spreadsheets, by memory, or not at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SterileCalc reduces that risk by encoding the math and the rules into a simple tool that provides real-time feedback as inputs change.
                </p>
                </div>

                <!-- THE PROBLEM -->
                <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    New procurement stakeholders often inherit sterile sourcing responsibilities without the context required to price and compare products correctly.
                    The same drug can appear in multiple strengths, vial sizes, and packaging formats, with different waste characteristics depending on:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prescribed dose and dosing frequency</li>
                    <li>Drug concentration (strength per mL)</li>
                    <li>Vial size and pack quantity</li>
                    <li>Preservative status (preserved vs preservative-free)</li>
                    <li>Supplier type and regulatory constraints (503A patient-specific vs 503B/commercial shared use)</li>
                    <li>USP <strong>&lt;797&gt;</strong> handling guidance for puncture/disposal windows</li>
                    <li>Best Use Date (BUD) and shelf-life expectations</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Without a consistent calculator, teams struggle to compare options apples-to-apples, especially when switching suppliers during shortages.
                </p>
                </div>

                <!-- WHY EXISTING APPROACHES FAILED -->
                <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>Why Existing Approaches Failed</h3>
                <p>
                    Most teams try to solve these calculations with one-off spreadsheets, tribal knowledge, or scattered notes. That approach breaks down because:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Spreadsheets rarely enforce unit consistency (mcg/mg/g) and are easy to mis-key.</li>
                    <li>Waste and disposal rules are often ignored or applied inconsistently across buyers.</li>
                    <li>503A restrictions (patient-specific use) fundamentally change dose availability.</li>
                    <li>People need an answer quickly while evaluating quotes, not a "modeling project."</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    SterileCalc was built as a "fast truth" layer: transparent inputs, immediate outputs, and logic aligned with real procurement constraints.
                </p>
                </div>

                <!-- SYSTEM DESIGN -->
                <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>System Design</h3>
                <p>
                    SterileCalc is a static web application built with HTML/CSS/JavaScript to maximize speed, accessibility, and portability.
                    The interface is optimized for use on both desktop and mobile devices, and the app works offline once loaded.
                </p>

                <h4>Core Design Principles</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Right-sized:</strong> no backend required, fast load, low maintenance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transparent:</strong> users can see exactly what assumptions drive results.</li>
                    <li><strong>Constraint-aware:</strong> calculations incorporate real-world sterile rules and purchasing restrictions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Immediate feedback:</strong> outputs update as inputs change to support quote evaluation and scenario checking.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Rule-Aware Logic</h4>
                <p>
                    The calculators encode procurement-relevant sterile constraints including USP &lt;797&gt; puncture/disposal guidance and sourcing restrictions for
                    503A versus 503B/commercial purchasing.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Preservative-free</strong> products assume disposal after a short puncture window (higher waste risk).</li>
                    <li><strong>Preserved</strong> products allow longer reuse windows (lower waste risk), bounded by BUD.</li>
                    <li><strong>503A purchases</strong> are treated as patient-specific, limiting usable doses per vial/unit based on a patient's 28-day protocol constraints.</li>
                    <li><strong>503B/commercial</strong> purchases assume shared use across patients (bulk in-office workflows).</li>
                </ul>
                </div>

                <p>
                    SterileCalc is built for non-procurement specialists who are responsible for buying and administering sterile drugs, including clinic operators, nurse-led practices,
                    med spa owners, and new procurement stakeholders who need fast, reliable calculations without building complex spreadsheets.

                <h3>Technical Notes</h3>
                <p>
                    SterileCalc is implemented as a static site with vanilla JavaScript. Key implementation patterns include unit normalization (mcg/mg/g),
                    defensive input validation, and transparent result strings designed to educate the user while answering the question.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Static web app:</strong> HTML/CSS/JS for speed, simplicity, and easy deployment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deterministic calculation functions:</strong> reusable functions for dose conversion, total content, doses per unit, cost per dose, and BUD math.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rule-aware branching:</strong> distinct logic paths for 503A vs 503B/commercial and preservative-free vs preserved handling assumptions.</li>
                    <li><strong>UX for clarity:</strong> inputs grouped by protocol, drug details, and supplier constraints to mirror how procurement evaluates products.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The app includes a clear disclaimer to reinforce that it supports procurement calculations and does not replace clinical judgment.
