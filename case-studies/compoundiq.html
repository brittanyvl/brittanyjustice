                503B facility lifecycle tracking from a single FDA spreadsheet, modeled into history you can monitor, query, and trust.
                </p>

                <!-- OVERVIEW -->
                <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    CompoundIQ is a regulatory intelligence platform that transforms the FDA's weekly 503B outsourcing facility
                    registration spreadsheet into a longitudinal data model. While the FDA publishes only a static, point-in-time
                    Excel file, CompoundIQ captures each release, preserves history, and models facilities, parent pharmacies,
                    inspections, regulatory actions, bulk API intent, recalls, and registration status over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The result is a system that makes change visible where none existed before — enabling monitoring, trend analysis,
                    and defensible decision-making in a highly regulated pharmacy market.
                </p>
                </div>

                <!-- CONTEXT / RISK -->
                <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>Context / Risk</h3>
                <p>
                    FDA 503B outsourcing facilities play a critical role in the sterile drug supply chain, especially during shortages.
                    Health systems, clinics, telehealth organizations, and GPOs rely on these facilities, yet the regulatory signals
                    that indicate supplier risk are fragmented and difficult to interpret.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The FDA's 503B registration list represents the authoritative public record, but it is not designed for operational
                    or strategic use. Each weekly update overwrites the past, eliminating the ability to answer basic questions about
                    how the supplier landscape evolves over time.
                </p>
                </div>

                <!-- THE PROBLEM -->
                <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    The core challenge was not visualization — it was the absence of time and identity in the source data.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data is released as a raw Excel spreadsheet with inconsistent formatting.</li>
                    <li>Weekly updates overwrite prior states, eliminating historical context.</li>
                    <li>Facilities and parent pharmacies lack stable identifiers.</li>
                    <li>Names and attributes shift subtly across releases.</li>
                    <li>Inspections, post-inspection actions, and recalls are not modeled as time-aware events.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Without re-engineering the dataset, longitudinal monitoring and reliable analytics are not possible.
                </p>
                </div>

                <!-- WHY EXISTING APPROACHES FAILED -->
                <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>Why Existing Approaches Failed</h3>
                <p>
                    In practice, teams attempt to manage this data through manual spreadsheet comparisons or snapshot-based BI tools.
                    These approaches fail quickly:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Manual comparisons do not scale and are not auditable.</li>
                    <li>Snapshot dashboards show "today" but cannot explain "what changed."</li>
                    <li>Without stable entity resolution, facility history becomes unreliable.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    CompoundIQ was designed to solve what was missing: <strong>time, identity, and structure</strong>.
                </p>
                </div>

                <!-- SYSTEM DESIGN -->
                <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>System Design</h3>
                <p>
                    CompoundIQ treats each FDA release as a point-in-time observation rather than a replacement. Weekly spreadsheets
                    are automatically collected, normalized, and preserved as history using Slowly Changing Dimensions (Type 2).
                </p>

                <h4>What the System Models</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Facilities and parent pharmacies</li>
                    <li>Registration status over time (added, removed, re-registered)</li>
                    <li>Inspection events and inspection cadence</li>
                    <li>Post-inspection actions (Untitled Letters, FMD-145 notices, Warning Letters)</li>
                    <li>Intent to compound sterile drugs from bulk APIs</li>
                    <li>Facilities associated with FDA recalls</li>
                    <li>High-level KPIs summarizing activity and change</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Entity Resolution</h4>
                <p>
                    The FDA source data contains significant text inconsistencies. CompoundIQ applies aggressive normalization and
                    deterministic ID generation to ensure that the same real-world facility remains identifiable across time.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Standardization of casing, punctuation, spacing, and corporate suffixes</li>
                    <li>Stable facility and parent IDs generated via deterministic hashing</li>
                    <li>Explicit handling of edge cases such as "AMERICA LLC" vs "AMERICALLC"</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Data Quality & Observability</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>37 automated dbt tests validating schema integrity and relationships</li>
                    <li>Freshness monitoring to ensure weekly captures are complete</li>
                    <li>Administrative interface for pipeline monitoring and debugging</li>
                </ul>
                </div>

                    facilities and need a reliable view of how the supplier landscape changes over time.

                <p>
                    The FDA spreadsheet is public, but history is not. CompoundIQ creates the missing layer by transforming a static
                    disclosure into a durable, time-aware model of reality. It demonstrates how messy, stateless regulatory data can
                    be re-engineered into structured facts and dimensions that support real decisions in a complex healthcare market.
