                Turning a fragmented licensing portal into a searchable, enriched directory and market analysis of California sterile compounding capacity.
                </p>

                <!-- OVERVIEW -->
                <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    In 2024, I built an <strong>interactive research application</strong> that scraped the California Board of Pharmacy license verification portal to collect every active
                    sterile compounding license, <strong>enriched each record</strong> using publicly available information, and delivered both (1) a <strong>searchable directory</strong> for safer sourcing and
                    (2) an <strong>analytical report</strong> on California's sterile compounding market structure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The outcome is a decision-ready dataset and application that helps providers, procurement teams, and analysts answer a deceptively hard question:
                    <strong>"Who is actually licensed to provide sterile compounded drugs in California, and what can they do?"</strong>
                </p>
                </div>

                <!-- CONTEXT / RISK -->
                <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>Context / Risk</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Sterile compounding</strong> supports critical therapies such as injections, infusions, and ophthalmic preparations. When legitimate access is limited,
                    patients and providers face pressure to take shortcuts: <strong>sourcing from unsafe channels</strong>, purchasing unapproved chemicals, or rationing expired supplies.
                    These behaviors increase <strong>patient harm</strong> and create legal and regulatory risk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    California is a <strong>high-demand market</strong> with a large population, but sterile access is constrained. The public licensing data exists,
                    yet it is <strong>not packaged</strong> in a way that supports real-world sourcing, oversight, or market understanding.
                </p>
                </div>

                <!-- THE PROBLEM -->
                <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    Patients, providers, and sourcing teams must navigate a <strong>patchwork of state licensing portals</strong> to identify eligible sterile compounders.
                    Even within a single state, the information is difficult to use operationally.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Discovery is hard:</strong> the licensing portal is not designed for targeted sourcing (specialty, condition, service type).</li>
                    <li><strong>Capabilities are missing:</strong> licensure alone does not explain what the pharmacy actually compounds or who they serve.</li>
                    <li><strong>Market visibility is poor:</strong> it is difficult to quantify capacity constraints or geographic distribution.</li>
                    <li><strong>Procurement decisions suffer:</strong> teams waste time on irrelevant listings and still miss viable options.</li>
                </ul>
                </div>

                <!-- WHY EXISTING APPROACHES FAILED -->
                <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>Why Existing Approaches Failed</h3>
                <p>
                    The licensing portal is optimized for <strong>one-off verification</strong>, not for sourcing workflows or market analysis. Users can look up a facility,
                    but they cannot easily:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Search across the market by <strong>service capability, specialty, or condition</strong></li>
                    <li>Separate <strong>patient-specific (503A)</strong> from <strong>bulk in-office (503B outsourcer)</strong> options</li>
                    <li>Understand what kinds of facilities hold sterile privileges (hospitals vs traditional pharmacies)</li>
                    <li>Analyze <strong>expiration risk</strong> and renewal cycles</li>
                    <li>Map <strong>geographic access</strong> and distribution</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Without data extraction and enrichment, the licensing data remains "public" but <strong>not truly usable</strong>.
                </p>
                </div>

                <!-- SYSTEM DESIGN -->
                <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>System Design</h3>
                <p>
                    I designed the application as a combined <strong>directory + analysis report</strong>. The pipeline begins with extraction of California sterile compounding
                    licenses and then enriches each listing using public web information to identify capabilities and relevance.
                </p>

                <h4>Data Collection</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scraped</strong> the California Board of Pharmacy license verification portal to collect sterile licenses</li>
                    <li><strong>Standardized</strong> core fields (license type, facility name, address, city/county/zip, expiration dates)</li>
                    <li><strong>Geocoded</strong> records (LAT/LONG) to enable mapping and access analysis</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Enrichment Layer (Differentiator)</h4>
                <p>
                    The licensing portal does not describe what facilities actually do. I <strong>enriched the dataset</strong> using publicly available information
                    (websites, social profiles, and online presence) to classify and make the directory searchable by real-world capability.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Facility type classification:</strong> medical facility, infusion center, sterile compounding pharmacy, veterinary-only, research center</li>
                    <li><strong>Service capability taxonomy:</strong> specialties, conditions served</li>
                    <li><strong>Affiliations:</strong> claimed accreditations, associations, industry signals</li>
                    <li><strong>Purchasing style signals:</strong> patient-specific vs bulk in-office sourcing; 503B outsourcer indicator where applicable</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Product Experience</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Interactive filters</strong> for facility type, city, specialty, condition, and accreditations</li>
                    <li><strong>Searchable results table</strong> with export/download for operational use</li>
                    <li><strong>Analysis tab</strong> with narrative + visualizations (license types, facility distribution, geography, expirations)</li>
                </ul>

                    <li><strong>Geographic access insight:</strong> identify coverage gaps and proximity constraints for in-person sterile services</li>
                    <li><strong>Renewal/turnover planning:</strong> anticipate license expirations and identify periods of high renewal volume</li>
                    <li><strong>Operational handoff:</strong> export a cleaned list for procurement workflows, outreach, or internal tracking</li>

                <p>
                    This project was built for stakeholders who need to <strong>source sterile compounded medications safely and legally</strong>, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Clinic operators</strong> and medical practices purchasing sterile compounds</li>
                    <li><strong>Procurement and supply chain teams</strong> supporting sterile sourcing</li>
                    <li><strong>Pharmacy operations leaders</strong> monitoring sterile compounding access</li>
                    <li><strong>Analysts</strong> evaluating market capacity, access, and licensing constraints</li>

                <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>
                    Licensing data is technically public, but it is <strong>not packaged for real-world decision-making</strong>. This project shows how to convert a single-state licensing portal into a
                    decision-ready directory with <strong>meaningful classification</strong>, <strong>searchable capability signals</strong>, and analysis that explains the market in plain language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also serves as a prototype for a broader vision: <strong>consolidating sterile compounding licensing across all 50 states</strong> into a unified directory that reduces friction,
                    improves sourcing safety, and makes regulated markets legible.
                </p>
