                A privacy-first, offline Android application for medical inventory tracking built for solo providers and mobile practices.
                </p>

                <!-- OVERVIEW -->
                <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    MedSupplyPro is a <strong>lightweight Android application</strong> designed to help solo healthcare providers manage medical
                    inventory without the overhead of cloud systems, subscriptions, or complex enterprise software.
                    It was built for practitioners such as <strong>RNs, NPs, PAs, chiropractors, and mobile IV operators</strong> who need
                    practical inventory tracking that works anywhere, even without an internet connection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app <strong>runs entirely offline</strong>, stores all data locally on the device, and requires <strong>no accounts or logins</strong>.
                    Its goal is to reduce operational friction while preserving privacy, simplicity, and control.
                </p>
                </div>

                <!-- CONTEXT / RISK -->
                <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>Context / Risk</h3>
                <p>
                    Many small healthcare practices still rely on <strong>spreadsheets, paper logs, or ad hoc systems</strong> to manage medical
                    supplies. These approaches are error-prone and make it difficult to answer basic operational questions:
                    what is in stock, where it is stored, what is expiring, and what is being wasted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Cloud-based inventory platforms</strong> often introduce new problems for small operators: recurring costs,
                    account management, internet dependency, and uncertainty about how sensitive data is stored or shared.
                    For mobile practices and solo providers, those tradeoffs are often unacceptable.
                </p>
                </div>

                <!-- THE PROBLEM -->
                <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    Solo providers need <strong>inventory visibility without enterprise complexity</strong>. Specifically, they need a system that:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Works offline</strong> in mobile or low-connectivity environments</li>
                    <li><strong>Does not require logins</strong>, accounts, or subscriptions</li>
                    <li>Keeps <strong>all data private</strong> and under the provider's control</li>
                    <li>Is <strong>simple enough</strong> to use daily without training</li>
                    <li>Supports <strong>basic reporting</strong> on usage, waste, and inventory value</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Existing tools typically optimize for large organizations, not for individual practitioners running lean operations.
                </p>
                </div>

                <!-- WHY EXISTING APPROACHES FAILED -->
                <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>Why Existing Approaches Failed</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Spreadsheets and pen-and-paper logs</strong> are flexible but fragile: they drift out of date, are hard to search,
                    and provide little insight into waste or usage patterns. On the other end of the spectrum, <strong>cloud-based
                    inventory systems</strong> impose cost, connectivity, and data-sharing requirements that many solo providers do not want.
                </p>
                <p>
                    MedSupplyPro was designed to sit <strong>deliberately between those extremes</strong>: more structured and reliable than a spreadsheet,
                    but far simpler and more private than enterprise SaaS tools.
                </p>
                </div>

                <!-- SYSTEM DESIGN -->
                <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>System Design</h3>
                <p>
                    MedSupplyPro is a <strong>native Android application</strong> built with a focus on durability, simplicity, and offline-first behavior.
                    All application logic and data storage live on the device, with <strong>no external network dependencies</strong>.
                </p>

                <h4>Design Principles</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Offline-first:</strong> the app functions fully without internet access.</li>
                    <li><strong>Privacy by design:</strong> no accounts, no tracking, no external data storage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Low cognitive load:</strong> workflows mirror how providers actually handle supplies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right-sized:</strong> supports essential inventory needs without unnecessary features.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Data Model & Workflow</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Catalog</strong> of drugs and medical supplies</li>
                    <li><strong>Custom locations</strong> and storage areas</li>
                    <li><strong>Shipments</strong> as the unit of inventory intake</li>
                    <li><strong>Generated inventory records</strong> tied to shipments</li>
                    <li><strong>Explicit logging</strong> of usage and waste</li>
                    <li><strong>Reporting views</strong> summarizing inventory value and waste</li>
                </ul>
                </div>

                    MedSupplyPro was developed as a <strong>capstone project</strong> and implemented as a native Android application with <strong>no third-party services</strong>.
                </p>

                    <li><strong>Language:</strong> Java</li>
                    <li><strong>Persistence:</strong> SQLite using Room ORM</li>
                    <li><strong>Architecture:</strong> traditional View-based UI (not Jetpack Compose)</li>
                    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> internal app storage for secure data isolation</li>
                    <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> no analytics, no logins, no network calls</li>
