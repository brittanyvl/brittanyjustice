                Turning CMS payor machine-readable files into analyzable pricing intelligence for the top oncology J-codes.
                </p>

                <!-- OVERVIEW -->
                <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    CMS requires payors to publish Machine Readable Files (MRFs) containing negotiated rates. In practice, these files are massive,
                    fragmented across index manifests and in-network rate files, and difficult to use for any targeted analysis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this project, I built a pipeline to collect and normalize negotiated rates for the <strong>top 50 oncology J-codes</strong> from a BCBS payor's CMS files,
                    enabling analysis of how payment rates vary by billing code and provider reference across published plans.
                </p>
                </div>

                <!-- CONTEXT / WHY IT MATTERS -->
                <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>Context / Why It Matters</h3>
                <p>
                    Oncology drugs represent some of the highest-cost items in healthcare reimbursement. Small changes in negotiated rates can have outsized financial impact for
                    providers, health systems, and risk-bearing entities. While MRFs theoretically improve transparency, the raw format is not decision-ready:
                    it requires engineering work to extract, filter, and structure the rates before any pricing analysis is possible.
                </p>
                </div>

                <!-- THE PROBLEM -->
                <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    CMS MRF data is technically public, but operationally difficult:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Discovery friction:</strong> payors publish an <em>index JSON</em> that references many rate files per plan and market.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scale:</strong> in-network files are extremely large JSON documents that can't be loaded into memory safely.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nested structure:</strong> negotiated rates live in deeply nested arrays, and provider identities are separated into reference blocks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Join complexity:</strong> rate entries often use <code>provider_reference</code> keys requiring separate provider-reference lookups.</li>
                    <li><strong>Analysis readiness:</strong> without flattening, even simple questions like "what's the negotiated rate for JXXXX?" are hard to answer.</li>
                </ul>
                </div>

                <!-- SOLUTION / APPROACH -->
                <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>
                    I built a two-stage extraction pipeline that turns the payor's CMS artifacts into normalized tables suitable for analysis:
                </p>

                <h4>Stage 1: Index Manifest → File Inventory</h4>
                <p>
                    The index file contains a <code>reporting_structure</code> array mapping plans to in-network file locations. I flatten that structure into a tabular inventory
                    so files can be selected, downloaded, and processed systematically.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Extract reporting entity metadata</li>
                    <li>Enumerate plans (name, market type, id type/id)</li>
                    <li>Enumerate in-network file descriptors and URLs</li>
                    <li>Write a clean index table for downstream processing</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Stage 2: Streaming In-Network Rate Files → Flat Rate Rows</h4>
                <p>
                    In-network files are too large for typical JSON loading. I used <strong>streaming JSON parsing</strong> to safely process them in a memory-efficient way.
                    The extraction focuses on the billing codes of interest (top oncology J-codes), and flattens the nested negotiated rates into row-level records.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stream <code>provider_references</code> to build a provider reference → NPI lookup</li>
                    <li>Stream <code>in_network</code> entries to extract billing code and negotiated rates</li>
                    <li>Output normalized rows: provider reference, billing code, negotiated rate</li>
                    <li>Designed for joinability to provider NPIs and plan metadata</li>
                </ul>
                </div>

                <!-- SYSTEM DESIGN / ENGINEERING HIGHLIGHTS -->
                <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>Engineering Highlights</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    <strong>Memory-safe processing:</strong> used <code>ijson</code> to stream and parse massive JSON files without loading them fully.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <strong>Separation of concerns:</strong> manifest flattening (what files exist) is decoupled from rate extraction (what's inside each file).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <strong>Join-ready outputs:</strong> structured outputs support downstream joins across entity → plan → provider → billing code.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <strong>Extensible design:</strong> the same pipeline pattern can scale to more payors, more billing code sets, and richer negotiated rate attributes.
                    </li>
                </ul>
