            <h2>CompoundIQ</h2>
            <p class="tagline">
            503B facility lifecycle tracking from a single FDA spreadsheet, modeled into history you can monitor, query, and trust.

            <!-- OVERVIEW -->
            <div class="case-study-section">
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                CompoundIQ is a regulatory intelligence platform that transforms the FDA’s weekly 503B outsourcing facility
                registration spreadsheet into a longitudinal data model. While the FDA publishes only a static, point-in-time
                Excel file, CompoundIQ captures each release, preserves history, and models facilities, parent pharmacies,
                inspections, regulatory actions, bulk API intent, recalls, and registration status over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                The result is a system that makes change visible where none existed before — enabling monitoring, trend analysis,
                and defensible decision-making in a highly regulated pharmacy market.
            </p>
            </div>

            <!-- CONTEXT / RISK -->
            <div class="case-study-section">
            <h3>Context / Risk</h3>
            <p>
                FDA 503B outsourcing facilities play a critical role in the sterile drug supply chain, especially during shortages.
                Health systems, clinics, telehealth organizations, and GPOs rely on these facilities, yet the regulatory signals
                that indicate supplier risk are fragmented and difficult to interpret.
            </p>
            <p>
                The FDA’s 503B registration list represents the authoritative public record, but it is not designed for operational
                or strategic use. Each weekly update overwrites the past, eliminating the ability to answer basic questions about
                how the supplier landscape evolves over time.
            </p>
            </div>

            <!-- THE PROBLEM -->
            <div class="case-study-section">
            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>
                The core challenge was not visualization — it was the absence of time and identity in the source data.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Data is released as a raw Excel spreadsheet with inconsistent formatting.</li>
                <li>Weekly updates overwrite prior states, eliminating historical context.</li>
                <li>Facilities and parent pharmacies lack stable identifiers.</li>
                <li>Names and attributes shift subtly across releases.</li>
                <li>Inspections, post-inspection actions, and recalls are not modeled as time-aware events.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Without re-engineering the dataset, longitudinal monitoring and reliable analytics are not possible.
            </p>
            </div>

            <!-- WHY EXISTING APPROACHES FAILED -->
            <div class="case-study-section">
            <h3>Why Existing Approaches Failed</h3>
            <p>
                In practice, teams attempt to manage this data through manual spreadsheet comparisons or snapshot-based BI tools.
                These approaches fail quickly:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Manual comparisons do not scale and are not auditable.</li>
                <li>Snapshot dashboards show “today” but cannot explain “what changed.”</li>
                <li>Without stable entity resolution, facility history becomes unreliable.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                CompoundIQ was designed to solve what was missing: <strong>time, identity, and structure</strong>.
            </p>
            </div>

            <!-- SYSTEM DESIGN -->
            <div class="case-study-section">
            <h3>System Design</h3>
            <p>
                CompoundIQ treats each FDA release as a point-in-time observation rather than a replacement. Weekly spreadsheets
                are automatically collected, normalized, and preserved as history using Slowly Changing Dimensions (Type 2).
            </p>

            <h4>What the System Models</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Facilities and parent pharmacies</li>
                <li>Registration status over time (added, removed, re-registered)</li>
                <li>Inspection events and inspection cadence</li>
                <li>Post-inspection actions (Untitled Letters, FMD-145 notices, Warning Letters)</li>
                <li>Intent to compound sterile drugs from bulk APIs</li>
                <li>Facilities associated with FDA recalls</li>
                <li>High-level KPIs summarizing activity and change</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Entity Resolution</h4>
            <p>
                The FDA source data contains significant text inconsistencies. CompoundIQ applies aggressive normalization and
                deterministic ID generation to ensure that the same real-world facility remains identifiable across time.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Standardization of casing, punctuation, spacing, and corporate suffixes</li>
                <li>Stable facility and parent IDs generated via deterministic hashing</li>
                <li>Explicit handling of edge cases such as “AMERICA LLC” vs “AMERICALLC”</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Data Quality & Observability</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>37 automated dbt tests validating schema integrity and relationships</li>
                <li>Freshness monitoring to ensure weekly captures are complete</li>

                The FDA spreadsheet is public, but history is not. CompoundIQ creates the missing layer by transforming a static
                disclosure into a durable, time-aware model of reality. It demonstrates how messy, stateless regulatory data can
                be re-engineered into structured facts and dimensions that support real decisions in a complex healthcare market.

        <h2>California Sterile License Study (2024)</h2>
        <p class="tagline">
        Turning a fragmented licensing portal into a searchable, enriched directory and market analysis of California sterile compounding capacity.
        </p>

        <!-- OVERVIEW -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            In 2024, I built an interactive research application that scraped the California Board of Pharmacy license verification portal to collect every active
            sterile compounding license, enriched each record using publicly available information, and delivered both (1) a searchable directory for safer sourcing and
            (2) an analytical report on California’s sterile compounding market structure.
        </p>
        <p>
            The outcome is a decision-ready dataset and application that helps providers, procurement teams, and analysts answer a deceptively hard question:
            <strong>“Who is actually licensed to provide sterile compounded drugs in California, and what can they do?”</strong>
        </p>
        </div>

        <!-- CONTEXT / RISK -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
        <h3>Context / Risk</h3>
        <p>
            Sterile compounding supports critical therapies such as injections, infusions, and ophthalmic preparations. When legitimate access is limited,
            patients and providers face pressure to take shortcuts: sourcing from unsafe channels, purchasing unapproved chemicals, or rationing expired supplies.
            These behaviors increase patient harm and create legal and regulatory risk.
        </p>
        <p>
            California is a high-demand market with a large population, but sterile access is constrained. The public licensing data exists,
            yet it is not packaged in a way that supports real-world sourcing, oversight, or market understanding.
        </p>
        </div>

        <!-- THE PROBLEM -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>
            Patients, providers, and sourcing teams must navigate a patchwork of state licensing portals to identify eligible sterile compounders.
            Even within a single state, the information is difficult to use operationally.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Discovery is hard:</strong> the licensing portal is not designed for targeted sourcing (specialty, condition, service type).</li>
            <li><strong>Capabilities are missing:</strong> licensure alone does not explain what the pharmacy actually compounds or who they serve.</li>
            <li><strong>Market visibility is poor:</strong> it is difficult to quantify capacity constraints or geographic distribution.</li>
            <li><strong>Procurement decisions suffer:</strong> teams waste time on irrelevant listings and still miss viable options.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- WHY EXISTING APPROACHES FAILED -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
        <h3>Why Existing Approaches Failed</h3>
        <p>
            The licensing portal is optimized for one-off verification, not for sourcing workflows or market analysis. Users can look up a facility,
            but they cannot easily:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Search across the market by service capability, specialty, or condition</li>
            <li>Separate patient-specific (503A-style purchasing) from bulk in-office (503B outsourcer) options</li>
            <li>Understand what kinds of facilities hold sterile privileges (hospitals vs traditional pharmacies)</li>
            <li>Analyze expiration risk and renewal cycles</li>
            <li>Map geographic access and distribution</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Without data extraction and enrichment, the licensing data remains “public” but not truly usable.
        </p>
        </div>

        <!-- SYSTEM DESIGN -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
        <h3>System Design</h3>
        <p>
            I designed the application as a combined <strong>directory + analysis report</strong>. The pipeline begins with extraction of California sterile compounding
            licenses and then enriches each listing using public web information to identify capabilities and relevance.
        </p>

        <h4>Data Collection</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Scraped the California Board of Pharmacy license verification portal to collect sterile licenses</li>
            <li>Standardized core fields (license type, facility name, address, city/county/zip, expiration dates)</li>
            <li>Geocoded records (LAT/LONG) to enable mapping and access analysis</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Enrichment Layer (Differentiator)</h4>
        <p>
            The licensing portal does not describe what facilities actually do. I enriched the dataset using publicly available information
            (websites, social profiles, and online presence) to classify and make the directory searchable by real-world capability.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Facility type classification:</strong> medical facility, infusion center, sterile compounding pharmacy, veterinary-only, research center</li>
            <li><strong>Service capability taxonomy:</strong> specialties, conditions served</li>
            <li><strong>Affiliations:</strong> claimed accreditations, associations, industry signals</li>
            <li><strong>Purchasing style signals:</strong> patient-specific vs bulk in-office sourcing; 503B outsourcer indicator where applicable</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Product Experience</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Interactive filters for facility type, city, specialty, condition, and accreditations</li>
            <li>Searchable results table with export/download for operational use</li>

        <!-- DECISIONS ENABLED -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
        <h3>Decisions Enabled</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Safer sourcing:</strong> quickly identify which facilities are actually licensed for sterile compounding and filter to relevant capabilities</li>
            <li><strong>Bulk vs patient-specific purchasing clarity:</strong> differentiate sourcing paths and constraints for in-office administration vs patient prescriptions</li>
            <li><strong>Market structure visibility:</strong> quantify what types of facilities hold sterile privileges (not just “pharmacies”)</li>
            <li><strong>Geographic access insight:</strong> identify coverage gaps and proximity constraints for in-person sterile services</li>
            <li><strong>Renewal/turnover planning:</strong> anticipate license expirations and identify periods of high renewal volume</li>
            <li><strong>Operational handoff:</strong> export a cleaned list for procurement workflows, outreach, or internal tracking</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- WHO THIS WAS FOR -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
        <h3>Who This Was For</h3>
        <p>
            This project was built for stakeholders who need to source sterile compounded medications safely and legally, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clinic operators and medical practices purchasing sterile compounds</li>
            <li>Procurement and supply chain teams supporting sterile sourcing</li>
            <li>Pharmacy operations leaders monitoring sterile compounding access</li>
            <li>Analysts evaluating market capacity, access, and licensing constraints</li>
        </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- WHY THIS MATTERS -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
        <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
        <p>
            Licensing data is technically public, but it is not packaged for real-world decision-making. This project shows how to convert a single-state licensing portal into a
            decision-ready directory with meaningful classification, searchable capability signals, and analysis that explains the market in plain language.
        </p>
        <p>
            It also serves as a prototype for a broader vision: consolidating sterile compounding licensing across all 50 states into a unified directory that reduces friction,
            improves sourcing safety, and makes regulated markets legible.

        <h3>Technical Notes (Secondary)</h3>
        <p>
            The application was implemented as an interactive Streamlit product with a pandas-based analytics layer and Plotly visualizations, backed by a cleaned and enriched CSV dataset.
            Key implementation details include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reusable filtering logic across multiple dimensions (facility type, geography, specialty, condition, accreditations)</li>
            <li>Term cleaning and normalization for searchable multi-value fields (specialties, conditions, accreditations)</li>
            <li>Geospatial visualizations using LAT/LONG for map-based exploration</li>
            <li>Download/export workflows to support operational use cases</li>
        </ul>
