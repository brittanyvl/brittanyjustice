                    <p>My path into pharmacy intelligence and data engineering started where the work is most tangible: managing sterile drug procurement for a national telehealth franchise. As Category Manager I owned the full procure-to-pay cycle for sterile compounds and medical supplies across a network of 200+ clinics. In many ways, we operated like a small GPO—negotiating with compounding pharmacies, managing supplier scorecards, forecasting demand, and protecting margins in a category where pricing is opaque and compliance stakes are high. That role gave me deep fluency in the operational and commercial realities of sterile drug sourcing.</p>

                    <p>An opportunity to lead a Salesforce implementation changed my trajectory. As a Salesforce Administrator, I designed custom data models, built procurement automation workflows, and collaborated directly with engineers to ship a complex medical supply procurement platform andmobile field service application. It was my first taste of building systems rather than just operating them. The work was GUI-based, but it planted a question I couldn't shake: what if I could build these tools myself, from scratch?</p>

                    <p>That curiosity led me to pursue a BS in Software Engineering while continuing to work full-time. I transitioned into a supply chain analytics role where I could apply what I was learning immediately. Python and SQL became my daily tools—automating invoice validation, building demand models, and designing BigQuery data marts to streamline procure-to-pay and order-to-cash workflows. I supported compliance and sourcing initiatives with data, reducing waste, improving margins, and cutting reporting cycles from weeks to days.</p>

                    <p>Today, I work as a Pharmacy Analytics Engineer at the nation's largest group purchasing organization where I am fully dedicated to the Compound Pharmacy domain. I modernize data infrastructure for compounding pharmacy analytics—rebuilding legacy Excel and MS Access workflows into production-grade medallion architectures, developing optimization engines that identify tens of millions in contract savings, and establishing engineering standards that have doubled our team's delivery velocity. I design the systems that help national pharmacy, sourcing, and clinical teams make defensible decisions in complex markets.</p>

                    <p>What ties it all together is a belief that the best analytics work requires both domain fluency and engineering discipline. I've sat in the procurement seat, negotiated the contracts, and felt the pain of bad data. That experience shapes how I build: systems that are operationally grounded, technically rigorous, and designed to support real decisions under real constraints.</p>
